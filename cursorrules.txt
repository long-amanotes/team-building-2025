You are an expert in TypeScript, React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Radix UI, and Zustand.

Project Context:
This is the NGD Team Building 2025 Dashboard - a React application displaying event information for Amanotes New Games Division team building at Asteria Mui Ne Resort (18-19/12/2025). The app shows schedule, room assignments, participants, menu, transport, and budget information.

Code Style and Structure:
- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError)
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/room-card)

Naming Conventions:
- Use PascalCase for components (e.g., RoomCard, ScheduleSection)
- Use kebab-case for file names (e.g., room-card.tsx, schedule-section.tsx)
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and hooks
- Prefix event handlers with "handle" (e.g., handleTabChange, handleSearch)
- Prefix boolean variables with is/has/should (e.g., isFamily, hasSpecialNote)
- Favor named exports for components

TypeScript Usage:
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types
- Avoid enums; use objects or maps instead
- Avoid using `any` or `unknown` unless absolutely necessary
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces for props

Syntax and Formatting:
- Use the "function" keyword for component definitions
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax
- Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deep nesting
- Use declarative JSX, keeping JSX minimal and readable

UI and Styling:
- Use Tailwind CSS for all styling with utility-first approach
- Use Shadcn UI components as the base (Card, Badge, Button, Tabs)
- Use Radix UI primitives for custom accessible components
- Implement responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Use consistent spacing (p-4, p-5, p-6) and rounded corners (rounded-2xl, rounded-3xl)
- Follow ocean theme color palette: cyan primary, slate backgrounds, emerald/amber accents

Component Architecture:
- Keep components small and focused (Single Responsibility)
- Use composition pattern to build complex UIs
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks (use- prefix)
- Use React.memo() strategically for list items
- Implement proper key props in lists (use unique IDs, not index)

Data Structure:
- All data is static, imported from /data directory
- Types are defined in /types directory
- Use Zod schemas if validation is needed

Key Files Structure:

Vietnamese Language:
- All UI text should be in Vietnamese
- Use proper Vietnamese diacritics
- Common labels: "Tổng quan", "Lịch trình", "Xếp phòng", "Ăn uống", "Di chuyển", "Ngân sách"

Performance:
- Use dynamic imports for non-critical components
- Optimize images: WebP format, lazy loading
- Minimize re-renders with proper memoization

Accessibility:
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Implement proper ARIA labels for icons and interactive elements
- Ensure keyboard navigation support
- Maintain color contrast for readability

Error Handling:
- Handle edge cases at the beginning of functions
- Use guard clauses for preconditions
- Provide user-friendly fallback UI for empty states

Do NOT:
- Use CSS classes or inline styles (use Tailwind only)
- Use class components
- Use any or unknown types without good reason
- Use index as key in lists
- Create oversized components (split if > 150 lines)
- Hardcode colors outside of Tailwind config
